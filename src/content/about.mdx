As a kid raised by internet forums, I was obsessed with customizing my signatures and &ldquo;about me&rdquo; sections on personal profiles using [BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode) (you can add `[2;37m[[0m[0;32mimg[0m[2;37m][0mcool-images.png[2;37m[[0m/[0;32mimg[0m[2;37m][0m{:ansi}` and `[2;37m[[0m[0;32mb[0m[2;37m][0mbold text[2;37m[[0m/[0;32mb[0m[2;37m][0m{:ansi}`!). I maximized personality and expression through these [gradient generator tools](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/textcolorizer) to add <span style='color:#FFC9C9;'>a</span><span style='color:#FFCBC4;'>w</span><span style='color:#FFCEBF;'>e</span><span style='color:#FFD1BA;'>s</span><span style='color:#FFD4B5;'>o</span><span style='color:#FFD6B0;'>m</span><span style='color:#FFD9AB;'>e</span> <span style='color:#FFDFA2;'>c</span><span style='color:#FFE29D;'>o</span><span style='color:#FFE498;'>l</span><span style='color:#FFE793;'>o</span><span style='color:#FFEA8E;'>r</span><span style='color:#FFED89;'>s</span>, these weird cursive <abbr title="Unicode characters">𝒰𝓃𝒾𝒸𝑜𝒹𝑒 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓇𝒶𝒸𝓉𝑒𝓇𝓈</abbr>, or perfectly dimensioned [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) GIF art. To this day, the web still remains my favorite design medium!

I currently study and perform undergraduate research in data science (with machine learning and artificial intelligence emphasis), but as a childhood dream of mine I wanted to design on the web —— to that end, I moonlight as a [contractable](mailto:jason@enscribe.dev) design engineer. I also am pretty heavily involved in the cybersecurity sphere, where I write [capture-the-flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) security challenges and organize events for [Project Sekai CTF](https://sekai.team) and the [Friendly Maltese Citizens](https://ctf.mt) (hence why the majority of my design work pertains to security companies).

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy everything music: discovering new albums, attending concerts, playing classical & electric guitar, and even going to arcades to play rhythm games (I have a secret personal page if you are interested <span class="text-muted-foreground/70">(●'⩌'●)</span>: [enscribe.dev/personal](https://enscribe.dev/personal)). I also do amateur photography (I have another secret page for this purpose <span class="text-muted-foreground/70">O(∩_∩)O</span>: [enscribe.dev/photography](https://enscribe.dev/photography)).
