My first experience with coding was in an elementary school computer lab, where at around age 8 I worked through a [Codecademy tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) on HTML and CSS. These markup language skills transferred well into customizing my signatures and &ldquo;about me&rdquo; sections on online forums using [BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode) (&ldquo;hey look, you can add a cool image with `[img]cool-pic.png[/img]` instead of `<img src="cool-pic.png">{:html}`!&rdquo;). I used these [gradient generator tools](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/textcolorizer) to add <span style='color:#3300FF;'>a</span><span style='color:#4109EC;'>w</span><span style='color:#5013DA;'>e</span><span style='color:#5E1DC8;'>s</span><span style='color:#6D26B6;'>o</span><span style='color:#7B30A3;'>m</span><span style='color:#8A3A91;'>e</span> <span style='color:#A74D6D;'>c</span><span style='color:#B6575B;'>o</span><span style='color:#C46148;'>l</span><span style='color:#D36A36;'>o</span><span style='color:#E17424;'>r</span><span style='color:#F07E12;'>s</span> or find weird <abbr title="Unicode characters">𝒰𝓃𝒾𝒸𝑜𝒹𝑒 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓇𝒶𝒸𝓉𝑒𝓇𝓈</abbr> to maximize coolness factor. In retrospect, this aspect of me hasn't changed at all (づ￣ 3￣)づ.

Admittedly I didn't see much of a career in making pretty internet pages at that point, until I took a computer science class in high school and found that I was *actively putting off* other workloads in order to make as many cool CS projects as possible. I guess this is where the term &ldquo;passion&rdquo; comes in.

Since I'm still undergoing education, my current status involves freelance work as a design engineer / web designer / whatever you want me to be ([say hi](mailto:jason@enscribe.dev) here to hire me!). I also am pretty heavily involved in the cybersecurity sphere, where I write [capture-the-flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) security challenges and organize events for [Project Sekai CTF](https://sekai.team) and the [Friendly Maltese Citizens](https://ctf.mt) (hence why the majority of my design work pertains to security companies).
