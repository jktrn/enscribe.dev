As a kid raised by internet forums, I was obsessed with customizing my signatures and &ldquo;about me&rdquo; sections on personal profiles using [BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode) (you can add `[2;37m[[0m[0;32mimg[0m[2;37m][0mcool-images.png[2;37m[[0m/[0;32mimg[0m[2;37m][0m{:ansi}` and `[2;37m[[0m[0;32mb[0m[2;37m][0mbold text[2;37m[[0m/[0;32mb[0m[2;37m][0m{:ansi}`!). I maximized personality and expression through these [gradient generator tools](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/textcolorizer) to add <span style='color:#FFC9C9;'>a</span><span style='color:#FFCBC4;'>w</span><span style='color:#FFCEBF;'>e</span><span style='color:#FFD1BA;'>s</span><span style='color:#FFD4B5;'>o</span><span style='color:#FFD6B0;'>m</span><span style='color:#FFD9AB;'>e</span> <span style='color:#FFDFA2;'>c</span><span style='color:#FFE29D;'>o</span><span style='color:#FFE498;'>l</span><span style='color:#FFE793;'>o</span><span style='color:#FFEA8E;'>r</span><span style='color:#FFED89;'>s</span>, these weird cursive <abbr title="Unicode characters">𝒰𝓃𝒾𝒸𝑜𝒹𝑒 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓇𝒶𝒸𝓉𝑒𝓇𝓈</abbr>, or perfectly dimensioned [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) GIF art. As such, the web today is my favorite design medium.

I currently am completing my undergraduate in data science with <abbr title="Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence">ML/AI</abbr> emphasis, but as a childhood dream of mine I wanted to design on the internet. To that end, I work as a [design engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_engineer#In_software_engineering) for products —— I&rsquo;m currently full-time at [OtterSec](https://osec.io). I am also pretty heavily involved in the cybersecurity sphere, where I author [capture-the-flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) security challenges and organize international competitions for [Project Sekai CTF](https://sekai.team) and the [Friendly Maltese Citizens](https://ctf.mt) <span class="text-muted-foreground">(which is why the majority of my design work pertains to security companies)</span>. Other than that, I've [dabbled in academia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15216) with some friends at Stanford University. If you want to see more of what I do, check out my [/work](/work) page.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy everything music: discovering new albums, attending concerts, playing classical & electric guitar, and even going to arcades to play rhythm games.
