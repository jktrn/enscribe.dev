## Introduction

So, we played BYUCTF 2022. There were **9 OSINT challenges**. 9. It was absolutely party-time for a CTF player w/ OSINT-emphasis like me, and a tragedy for people who dislike the inherently guessy nature behind the genre. Our team managed to solve them all, so here was our (albeit flawed) thought process behind it.

<Callout variant="remark">
  Some of our lines of reasoning don't make sense at all.
  That's normal for this category, and it comes from a crap ton of
  brainstorming, guesswork, and admin communication. I'll try my best to include
  wrong paths that we took, but for the sake of brevity some of it will be
  omitted.
