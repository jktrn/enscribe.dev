I did a quick [Google Lens](https://lens.google/) search with my phone with the keyword "BYU" attached and [this](https://universe.byu.edu/2012/09/27/5-campus-locations-you-didnt-know-existed/) article turned up:

> Jason Turner is a BYU computer science program graduate who works at DreamWorks and created all the data for Po's character. The statue is a tribute to his success, as well as the University's program and alumni.

Since the tribute is for Jason Turner, we can assume the signature is below his foot. The flag is `byuctf{Jason_Turner}`.
