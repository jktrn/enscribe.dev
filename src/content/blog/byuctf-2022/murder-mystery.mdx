  While searching for secrets of the past, you find a scrap of paper that
  contains the following information:
  ```text
  01101110011100100110100001110000011010-
  01011001000100110001001011110100001111
  June 29, 1902
  ```
  Because you're great at OSINT, you trace this information
  back to a famous inscription. What is that inscription?  
  **Flag**: `byuctf{inscription_with_underscores}`  
  **Note**: the flag will not include the name or dates found in the inscription.

Instantly, we moved to [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for the binary conversion, and it resulted in `nrhpidLK√ê`. We thought it was garbage at first, until a teammate noticed "NRHP ID" within the string, which is related to the [National Register of Historic Places](https://history.idaho.gov/nrhp/). Since there's a historic date also in the description, we can immediately conclude that this is the correct path to take. We isolated the last part and converted it into decimal instead - `80002319`.

Following the trail for `NRHP ID 80002319`, we found this [UpWiki Page](https://en.upwiki.one/wiki/Jesse_James_Home_Museum) About the "Jesse James Home Museum", which is the location registered under this ID.

When we looked up "jesse james famous inscription", we found a [Smithsonian Magazine](https://photocontest.smithsonianmag.com/photocontest/detail/the-original-grave-site-of-jesse-james-located-in-the-yard-of-the-james-fam/) page that photographs Mr. James' grave:

Removing the dates and names as the description specifies, the flag is `byuctf{murdered_by_a_traitor_and_coward_whose_name_is_not_worthy_to_appear_here}`.
