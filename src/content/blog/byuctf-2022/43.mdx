  It's at your fingertips!! Who made this code? `` S fsu om yjr aogr 3"45` ``  
  format: `byuctf{blank_blank}`
</Challenge>

Looks like something the [DCode Cipher Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) could figure out:

```text
dCode's analyzer suggests to investigate:
Keyboard Shift Cipher ■■■■■■■■■▪
Substitution Cipher ▪
Shift Cipher ▪
Homophonic Cipher ▫
ROT Cipher ▫
```

I threw it into their [Keyboard Shift Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/
keyboard-shift-cipher) and got this:

```text
qwerty → A day in the \ife 2:34
qwerty ← D gdi p, ukt spht 4A56
qwerty ↓↻ W va7 ln ume slf4 e:v6
qwerty ↑4 S fsu om yjr aogr 3_45
qwerty ↓4 S fsu om yjr aogr 3{45
```

"A Day in the Life" is a song by the [Beatles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=usNsCeOV4GM) (a fascinatingly good one too), and I took a look the decoded
timestamp `2:34` in the music video:

Although I couldn't find who the person in the timestamp was, someone in the
comments named the individuals at timestamps:

![Nesmith](assets/43-3.png)

The guy at 3:31 is the same as the guy at 2:34, so it's Michael Nesmith from the
Monkees.

Looking up "Monkees 43" on Google, we discover that there's actually an old
website called [monkeesrule43.com](https://www.monkeesrule43.com/articles.html).

This is where you guess all the names of the Monkees. Not sure of the logical
thought process yet. Flag is `byuctf{micky_dolenz}`.

<Callout variant="remark" title="Edit (06/02/22)">
  The intended solve was to look at [monkeesrule43.com](https://www.monkeesrule43.com/articles.html). In their [FAQ page](https://www.monkeesrule43.com/faq.html), Question 13 asks:
  
  > 13.) What does the weird writing on Micky's page of the Monkees' 2001 summer tourbook mean?
  > - Micky's page is written in a computer keyboard code. Each letter written stands for the letter to the left of it on a computer keyboard. For example, &quot;Zovlu&quot; means Micky & &quot;Jo!&quot; means Hi!
  
  This intended solution was pretty weird. Whoever wrote this challenge is probably the #1 Beatles fan of all time if they can remember stuff like this.
