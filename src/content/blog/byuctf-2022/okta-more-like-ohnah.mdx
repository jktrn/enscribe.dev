  Recently, the group known as LAPSUS$ released indications they breached Microsoft & one of the Largest SSO companies, Okta. In some of their leaks they hinted that "most of the time if you don't do anything like __________, you won't be detected".  
  Flag format: `byuctf{answer:timestamp in format HH:MM}`, two word answer seperated by an underscore.
</Challenge>

Looks like a challenge regarding an infamous hacking group. Seeing that the flag asks for a timestamp and the language is pseudo-colloquial, I'd safely assume that this text mentioned somewhere came from a messaging board. I downloaded _Telegram_, their main method of communication with the real world, joining their [announcements board](https://t.me/minsaudebr), yet upon a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> I couldn't find this message anywhere. Their board mentions a [group chat](https://t.me/saudechat), but it was recently purged and terminated. When the admin confirmed that this wasn't the intended solution, I moved towards looking for screenshots surrounding the Okta leak. Our team found this [tweet from John Hammond](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1506166671664463875) after a while:

The flag is `byuctf{port_scanning_11:22}`. A hint was later added to the challenge:

> think screenshots! it is not on telegram but another platform with that same first letter. tweeted by a famous red head i think

It would have been much easier with this information... love you, John Hammond.
