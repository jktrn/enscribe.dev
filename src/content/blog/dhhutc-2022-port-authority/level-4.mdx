  The algorithm disturbed our radar system - boats that veer too far off track are lost and never seen again. Can you give them directions in time?

This means I can flag this level without needing to code at all!:

<video className="my-4 rounded-md" controls>
  <source src={Flag4Video} type="video/mp4" />

import Code21 from './assets/21.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code21} lang="ansi" mark="CTF{C4pt41N-4MErIc4}" />
