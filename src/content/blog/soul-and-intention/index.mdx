## Introduction

I believe that field of frontend web development has, for better or worse, become a solved problem. No-code, prompt-driven tooling like [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) and [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) have trivialized website creation -- you ask for anything with natural language, it spits something out, and you're prompted to seamlessly deploy it to some hosting solution like Vercel or Netlify. In no step throughout this process did an end user need to code or configure. Frontend has become even more accessible for those already technically proficient in other fields (e.g. backend/infra people) since they can just "vibe" a frontend and focus on "the more important things."

We celebrate this as some form of democratization -- it's great that someone non-technical doesn't need to go through the hurdles of wrangling with HTML and stylesheets. Yet, as I've observed this rapid industrialization of web creation, I've also noticed the quiet death of something that I hold incredibly dear -- intentionality.

The web is by far and away my favorite place to design. I embrace all of its ridiculous constraints, compatibility issues, its nonsensical caveats. I find that the "functional" or "conversion-oriented" perspective that the SF-tech-bro archetype often opt for is completely moronic, and the web, at its best, is a medium for human expression. We take all of these disparate components -- typography, color theory, micro-interactions, negative space -- and turn them into an experience that can reveal something essential and meaningful about the creator. This, by definition, is what art is. The titration of this process into a prompt window is tragic and horrifying.

### Who to blame

I think the problem always ends up coming back to tech bros. To help understand this, I'll establish two "worlds" that one can affiliate themselves with: the tech world, and the art world.

When Stable Diffusion dropped for AI-generated imagery, artists didn't just complain about job displacement or "loss of opportunity" (an economic reason), but they also articulated why the process of creation matters (an ideological reason). The resistance in the art world, at least to me, has worked to some capacity -- AI imagery is still widely considered to look hollow. soulless, and/or uncanny by broader culture. The only reason why this is the case, though, is because the art world has had actual *millennia* to establish the cultural infrastructure they need to resist AI takeover. Anyone with a pulse understands the value that art provides to human expression, and how taking away the human touch leaves effectively nothing.

The tech world's response to LLMs has been effectively self-sabotage. I have way too much to complain about regarding this matter, so I'll divvy it up:

- Developers revel at their own obsolescence. They'll call themselves 100x engineers with their multi-instances of Devin or Claude Code or whatever solution will replace the highest percentage of brain matter.
- Remember how I mentioned that artists gave both economic and ideological reasoning behind resisting AI? Tech bros frankly only care about the money part, that's why they're in the business -- as such, as long as you exist in the tech sphere you will perpetually hear "wahh I'm gonna be unemployed" and "wahh I'm being replaced by a chatbot" and "when are they implementing UBI?" rather than anything ideological.
- Tech culture fetishizes efficiency. We want the "smartest" solutions to have the least friction and effort. That's why you see so many Twitter blue-checkmark tech microcelebrities (who, by the way, are all morons) with Ghibli-style AI-generated profile pictures because in their head, they've outclevered the system by obtaining a "good enough" heuristic of what their face looks like without needing the assistance of an artist or, God forbid, learning how to draw themselves or, God forbid, just using a normal profile picture off Google Images like everyone else has been for the past 50 years. The inherent generic-ness of a shitty Ghibli profile picture doesn't ever register as a problem for them because they're optimizing different variables entirely.
- Creative deprivation is cancerous. People immersed in tech environments have emasculated themselves of creative expression due to a culture that exclusively rewards analytical thinking while systematically assigning creativity as something "frivolous" or "too abstract" or somehow less serious than "real work."

### Self-sabotage in the name of best practice

The design industry, specifically scoped to web design, is even worse off. Since it sits in the uncomfortable grey-area between the tech world and the art world, neither party claims it. Yet, it still remains vulnerable to the relentless optimization of the former and the relentless subjectivity of the latter.

Even before AI tooling, we've been self-sabotaging our creative liberties through aggressive standardization and abstractions in the name of "best practices" (I'll admit that many of these best practices are valid and good, but the caveat comes soon). We homogenize visual language with component libraries and design systems, which eliminate the need to make aesthetic decisions because these libraries are marketed as "designed by professionals" and "best practice." Even though it seems logical/optimal that we use these (lest we reinvent the wheel through remaking 40 different button states and form fields for every client), now everything on the internet that is "best practice" also happens to look exactly like each other. A landscape painting with templated trees that are "very tree-like" and "psychologically optimized to look like a tree" and a pre-made mountain loses a bit of soul, don't you think?

The greatest offender is, in my opinion, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) (with Google's Material design system coming in close). This library is actually great to use, since it follows great accessibility standards and UX expectations (for example, tabbing to a button should show a border ring to indicate it is in-focus). Its primary issue, which funnily enough is completely out of its control, was that it attempted to mitigate the everything-looks-the-same issue by claiming itself to be a clean baseline that its users can customize and build on top of (hell, the first sentence in the documentation is **"This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library."**). To no one's surprise, everyone decided to rawdog the standard library without any customization, defeating its entire purpose and making the web look even more same-y but now with a different and cool Vercel hacker Next.js aesthetic.

This has only been exacerbated with LLMs -- of course it would like these standardizations, because then its less context that it has to eat to generate a button or an input. Anthropic models tend to shit out React and default shadcn/ui components without you even asking for it (imagine saying "How should I structure my essay?" and it outputs a React-based flowchart). Even though we used to manually place the templated trees and mountains in their various locations on the canvas, which was better than nothing, now we have fucking robots that will do it for you in a hyperoptimized and speedy way that makes your landscape painting look maximally landscape-y. And everyone in industry took the bait.

### Cleaning up after ourselves

I think it's fine to embrace these tools as "a means to an end" for things that you can't be bothered with. You cannot catch me lacking because it is evident from my WakaTime that I have 1,000 hours in Cursor. My point is that we cannot be replacing the only good thing that's left within frontend web development, the design aspect, with slop. In a similar manner to how we quickly figured out what constitutes AI prose (e.g. overusing "It's not just [A], it's also [B]" form, vocabulary such as "tapestry" and "embodiment," em dashes, colons in titles, etc.), our pattern recognition skills have quickly enabled us to point out a vibed website. See this tweet chain:

TWEET CHAIN

I just want to emphasize that there are entire universes of creative opportunities that arise from designing and implementing your sites with (1) soul and (2) intention. The concept of "making the web more fun" is overused, but I genuinely believe that when you have fun designing, your visitors will have fun looking at what you create. Care about inconsequential things that people will never see, consider things that might never happen, pay the greatest attention to detail as you can possibly muster -- this is my design philosophy, and I hope this is reflected in the work that I produce. I love what I do, and the process doesn't feel like work to me -- maybe this will be the case for you as well.

## Developing subconscious taste

At this point, I'd like to transition into my actual design process. The word "process" here sucks because there's an implication of coherentness and order but, of course, this is never the case. There are a couple immediate issues I see:

1. Design requires "taste." Taste is such a horrible thing because many people dismiss it as something that is just magically handed to you by the grace of God as an infant. Taste is, when condensed, the ability to subconsciously understand when something looks/feels/smells/tastes/sounds "correct" (input), or the abililty to create that something (output). Condensed even further, it is dozens, if not hundreds of micro-decisions that you either consciously or unconsciously make when intaking or outputting something. Although taste can be a talent, it is also a skill, and it needs to be honed through experience and practice (similar to anything that a human can be "good at," e.g. you are somehow a piano prodigy but you are nothing without practice).
2. You'll be perpetually unhappy with what you make. This is due to either **(1)** you haven't iterated enough, or **(2)** you've iterated a lot but you're approaching it from the wrong angle. This is probably the biggest barrier that I face, and for this reason I often employ a "pair designing" strategy which basically guarantees a fresh perspective on anything you create.
3. It's difficult to quantify improvement. Continuing that piano analogy I made earlier, it's easier to see improvement via harder repetoire or more emotional/nuanced performances. In design, something simply "looking better" is hard to quantify, but it is often the case that when looking back at previous work, you have a sense of linear progression in terms of how happy you are with the result in retrospect. The further you go back in your portfolio, the more flaws you should be able to point out and the more "I would have done [x] differently"s you should be able to say.

My goal by the end of this post is to have someone who otherwise dismisses themselves as "horrible at design" (the majority of technical people) understand that design isn't daunting, but rather a productive (in that it's still tech-related) way to express yourself. Maybe it will incentivize you to vibe less of your frontend and make sometehing fun.

### A website that shows who you are

The most expressive thing that I've probably done is this website you're looking at. It's hard to get more personal than a personal website, and it really sucks when people make generic white-on-black or black-on-white sites for the sake of "looking clean." Us humans are messy and filled with dreams, aspirations, nostalgia, cherished things, cherished people, and it's never a bad idea to really show who you are.

I will go through the entire process, from start to finish, denoting as many subconscious decisions as I possibly can, of how I conceptualized the "bento box" layout on my homepage. Hopefully you'll be able to see how I approach design.

### Ideation

Of course, I didn't start with a bento box. The current homepage has had maybe a dozen revisions done to it since I came up with the idea in 2023. I, and most likely you, started with a generic hackery website as well -- it was only after countless ideas accumulating on top of each other that it got to this point. Here are some screenshots of progression of my website:

TODO

Although they may look very different (exclusively because my design skills improved throughout this entire process) in general I followed several mantras through every iteration:
- My homepage should show character. Although I used to do this with the way I write, eventually this ended up manifesting as an actual character (the sepia-colored cartoon guy you see throughout my blog, which we'll call a "bean guy"). This bean guy caricature of myself is meaningful because I used to draw him while doodling in middle school, since I had no idea how to properly draw a human (and because it looks cute). This also brings up the point that meaning, even when personal and unbeknownst to anyone else, provides a lot of value. [TODO: Talk about how the face is intentionally short, size of the mouth, size of the eyes, etc]
- My homepage should quickly introduce myself. I used to do this with a small paragraph blurb (which is basically what every personal homepage does), but when I was making the bento box I really felt like it looked like a cartoon panel, so I opted for the approach of having text bubbles come out of the bean guy to emulate me "talking" to the user, which makes it feel a tad bit more personal.
- My homepage should have interactivity. Little micro-interactions, no matter how small, can provide a lot of life to an otherwise static site. This is why I ended up adding those hover effects that you'll see the implementation process for later.
- My homepage should show data about myself. This ended up being the Spotify status, Discord status, WakaTime bar chart, and the GitHub calendar. In hindsight this idea was incredible, especially since it's appropriate for a bento box format in that there are lots of disparate but related things being shoved together coherently.
- My homepage should be functional. If we regress back to the SF tech-bro mentality, the goal of a homepage is to get the user to interact and move somewhere else that retains them on the site (a.k.a. exploring). All of the above help increase retention (you need to stay a bit longer to comprehend and explore the graphs, micro-interactions, hover efffects, etc.), but I additionally include social links that will further coax the user into doing something insidious like following me on Twitter and GitHub (do that please, you're already here!).

### Colors and swatches

When I make a website, the very first thing I do is think about colors. I'm not a color theory snob or anything along those lines, but I do understand that color is incredibly important to conveying a particular vibe to a user, especially when the site is commercial (e.g. you don't want your yoga class one-pager to be grunge black and blood red).

The 60-30-10 rule is a great first step. It states that 60% of your site, visually, should be a primary color, 30% should be a secondary color, and 10% should be an accent color. The point of this is to establish visual hierarchy, where the 10% is meant to draw the user's eye (e.g. a button or a link, in general more important things).

<Callout variant="remark">
I know I dunked on "best practices" earlier, but I only really do so because people use it as an excuse to be lazy on the design front. From now on, when I mention a rule or "best practice," it is because it is an objectively valid design choice to make.

Personally, I don't even like this ratio and often opt to not use a secondary color due to it introducing too much noise. Rather, a secondary color will emerge when needing to [...]
