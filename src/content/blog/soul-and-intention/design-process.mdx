## Building websites we cherish
</div>

This subpost is dedicated to exploring the process of designing/implementing the homepage of this website.

It's hard to get more personal than a personal website, and it really sucks when people make generic white-on-black or black-on-white sites for the sake of "looking clean." Us humans are messy and filled with dreams, aspirations, nostalgia, cherished things, cherished people, so it's never a bad idea to really show who you are.

The goal of all of this is to describe as many (sub)conscious decisions as possible, to help fingerprint what my sense of style is and how I approach design.

### Iteration, ideation

Of course, I didn't start with a bento box. I, and most likely you, started with a generic hackery template theme as well -- it was only after countless ideas accumulating on top of each other that it got to this point. Here are some screenshots of the progression of my website, which coincidentally has had one major design overhaul every year for the past four years:

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-2 my-4 [&_*]:m-0">
  <div>
    ![2022](assets/2022.png)
    <figcaption className="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground text-center [&>p]:mt-2 [&>p]:mb-4">
      2022
    </figcaption>
  </div>
  <div>
    ![2023](assets/2023.png)
    <figcaption className="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground text-center [&>p]:mt-2 [&>p]:mb-4">
      2023
    </figcaption>
  </div>
  <div>
    ![2024](assets/2024.png)
    <figcaption className="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground text-center [&>p]:mt-2">
      2024
    </figcaption>
  </div>
  <div>
    ![2025](assets/2025.png)
    <figcaption className="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground text-center [&>p]:mt-2">
      2025
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</div>

Although they may look very different, in general I followed several mantras through every iteration:

- **My homepage should quickly introduce myself.** I used to do this with a small paragraph blurb, but when I was making the bento box, I really felt like it looked like a cartoon panel. As such, I opted for the approach of having text bubbles come out of the bean guy to emulate me "talking" to the user, which makes it feel a tad bit more personal.
- **My homepage should have interactivity.** Little micro-interactions, no matter how small, can provide a lot of life to an otherwise static site. This is why I ended up adding those hover effects. You'll see the implementation process for these later.
- **My homepage should show data about myself.** This ended up being the Spotify status, Discord status, WakaTime bar chart, and the GitHub calendar. In hindsight, this idea was incredible, since there are lots of disparate but related things, which is perfect for a bento box format.
- **My homepage should be engaging.** If we regress back to the SF tech-bro mentality, the goal of a homepage is to get the user to interact and move somewhere else that retains them on the site <span class="text-muted-foreground">(a.k.a. exploring).</span> All of the above help increase retention <span class="text-muted-foreground">(you need to stay a bit longer to comprehend and explore the graphs, micro-interactions, hover effects, etc.)</span>. I also include social links that will further coax the user into doing something insidious, like following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enscry) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jktrn) <span class="text-muted-foreground">(do that please, you're already here!)</span>.
- **My homepage should show character.** Although I used to do this with the way I write, eventually this ended up manifesting as an actual character <span class="text-muted-foreground">(the sepia-colored cartoon guy you see throughout my blog, which we'll call a "bean guy").</span> The bean guy is a caricature of myself that I started doodling in middle school, mostly because I couldn't draw people well <span class="text-muted-foreground">(and also because he just looks cute).</span> Even if no one else knows the backstory, adding something so personal gives the site a unique touch and makes it feel more alive.
    <Callout variant="intuition" title="Making the bean guy">
    To illustrate what I mean by "denoting as many subconscious decisions as I possibly can," let me go through the process of how I made the bean guy:

    <span class="[&>img]:border-none">![Default bean guy](assets/bean.png)</span>

    The choices behind this design weren't made through conscious deliberation <span class="text-muted-foreground">(or if they did, they happened in seconds)</span>, meaning they just felt right to me; I didn't need to experiment or iterate much to get to a point where I was happy:

    <span class="[&>img]:border-none">![Bean guy decisions](assets/bean-decisions.png)</span>
    
    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-0 [&>li::marker]:[content:'('counter(list-item)')_']">
        <li>Adding a nose is fine, but for some reason leaving it out makes the character cuter, so no nose.</li>
        <li>Placing the face exactly in the center makes him look too chubby for my taste.</li>
        <li>Putting the face too close to the edge looks odd, so I keep it off-center with enough padding inside the head.</li>
        <li>If the eyes are too small or the mouth too narrow, he looks derpy.</li>
        <li>If the eyes or mouth are too large, he starts to look like a monster.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-0 [&>li::marker]:[content:'('counter(list-item)')_']" start="6">
        <li>The shoulders can't be too wide, or he looks slumped.</li>
        <li>The body color should differ from the face to separate them visually. Even though there's a shadow added under the chin here, it doesn't do enough visually.</li>
        <li>The bean needs human proportions; here, the shoulders are too high and the body too short.</li>
        <li>The body shouldn't be too long.</li>
        <li>If you add rounded corners to the bottom, then the shoulders lose their "shoulder" shape.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    Another great thing about the bean guy is that because he is so simple, he is also easily accessorized:

    <span class="[&>img]:border-none">![Bean guy accessories](assets/bean-accessories.png)</span>

    This was great to use in my [Japan retrospective](/blog/japan-retrospective) post to censor out my family members' faces whilst still identifying them. There are also a lot of details here:
    
    - The accessories actually represent habits that my family members have <span class="text-muted-foreground">(e.g. Dad wearing a tie, Little Brother always wearing headphones, Mom with a flower pin)</span>.
    - In general, everything has to be sepia-colored to match the overall theme. The accessories I picked were either hand-made or found on Google Images with the `filetype:svg` filter.
    - Even though Dad can wear a tie, I also decided that he'd have a darker body color to differentiate him from me <span class="text-muted-foreground">(the unaccessorized bean)</span> since we both have no accessory on our heads. In the end, everyone has a very slightly different body color, which might not be noticeable on bad monitors but is fine for me.
    - The version of me with a scarf is actually only used a single time, on the homepage for when my character is in a "cold climate" setting <span class="text-muted-foreground">(a mountain range)</span>.

    Little details like this can make a big difference in how meaningful your presentation is.

### Color palettes

Whenever I make a website, the very first thing I do is think about colors. I'm not a color theory snob or anything along those lines, but I do understand that color is incredibly important to conveying a particular connotation to a user, especially when the site is commercial <span class="text-muted-foreground">(e.g. you don't want your yoga class one-pager to be grunge black and blood red)</span>. I don't need to go through all the colors and their cultural connotations since it is self-evident.

We use the 60-30-10 rule to establish hierarchy:

<Callout variant="definition" title="60-30-10 rule">
  60% of your site's visual space should use a "primary" color, 30% should use a "secondary" color, and the remaining 10% should be reserved for an "accent" color. Secondary colors are often used to denote sections, while accent colors are used for elements that are meant to grab attention, like buttons or links.
</Callout>

Personally, I find that sticking rigidly to this ratio can feel exhausting, and I prefer to design more intuitively and only refer back to the ratio as a sanity check after the fact.

#### Semantic CSS variables

That said, one guideline I do always stick to is using semantically-named color variables in my CSS, which makes the process so much less painful when you're working with a lot of colors/have to change them. I've provided a large example below to illustrate how this works:

<Callout variant="example" title="Semantic CSS variables">
Let's make a generic hero section! On the left is the HTML source, and on the right is how it renders with no CSS:

<example-section class="grid grid-cols-1 my-4 [&_*]:m-0">
  <example-source>
    ```html title="index.html"
    <section>
      <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
      <p>This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!</p>
    </section>
    ```
  </example-source>
  <example-preview>
    <iframe
      srcdoc={`<section>
  <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
  <p>This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!</p>
</section>`}
      style={{
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        background: "white",
        colorScheme: "light",
      }}
      sandbox="allow-same-origin"
      className="h-auto w-full"
    />
  </example-preview>
</example-section>

We'll use Tailwind CSS for this example to warm you up with the notation if you've never seen it before, since it will be important later on. The notation is intuitive: `bg-amber-100` adds an amber-colored background of shade `100` to the section <span class="text-muted-foreground">(where Tailwind has shades `100`-`900` in steps of 100, with an additional `950` for super-dark)</span>:

<example-section class="grid grid-cols-1 my-4 [&_*]:m-0">
  <example-source>
    ```html title="index.html"
    <section class="bg-amber-100">
      <!-- 12px bottom margin, 24px font size, 500 font weight -->
      <h1 class="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900">
        Welcome to our website
      </h1>
      <!-- 1.625 line height, 600 font weight -->
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-stone-500">
        This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!
      </p>
    </section>
    ```
  </example-source>
  <example-preview>
    <iframe
      srcdoc={`<style>
        section {
          background: #fef3c6;
          padding: 2rem;
        }
        h1 {
          color: #1c1917;
          font-size: 1.5rem;
          font-weight: 600;
          margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
        }
        p {
          color: #79716b;
          line-height: 1.6;
        }
      </style>
      <section>
        <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
        <p>This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!</p>
      </section>`}
      style={{
        width: "100%",
        height: "200px",
        background: "white",
        colorScheme: "light",
      }}
      sandbox="allow-same-origin"
      className="h-auto w-full"
    />
  </example-preview>
</example-section>

We can go even further to add a darkmode. With Tailwind, we can add a `dark:` variant prefix to any class to only apply it when the [`prefers-color-scheme` media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) is `dark`. Since we can't demonstrate this without changing system preferences, we'll need to manually control the theme. This is done by overriding the `dark:` variant to select for an attribute `data-theme="dark"`:

```css title="styles.css"
@import "tailwindcss";

@custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *));
```

We can now use this in our HTML with a tiny script that will toggle the `data-theme` attribute. For my colors, I've made the design decision to have a "warm"-temperature light mode <span>(the `stone` palette)</span> and a "cool"-temperature dark mode <span>(the `slate` palette)</span>, since Tailwind's color palettes offer different shades of gray for this use case:

![Warm and cool temperature palettes](assets/tailwind-temperatures.png)

<example-section class="grid grid-cols-1 my-4 [&_*]:m-0">
  <example-source>
    ```html title="index.html" add="data-theme=\"light\"" add="dark:"
    <button onclick="toggleTheme()" class="mb-2">Toggle theme</button>
    <section class="bg-amber-100 dark:bg-slate-800" data-theme="light">
      <h1 class="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900 dark:text-slate-100">
        Welcome to our website
      </h1>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-stone-500 dark:text-slate-400">
        This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!
      </p>
    </section>

    <script>
      function toggleTheme() {
        const section = document.querySelector('[data-theme]');
        const currentTheme = section.getAttribute('data-theme');
        section.setAttribute('data-theme', currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
      }
    </script>
    ```
  </example-source>
  <example-preview>
    <iframe
      srcdoc={`
        <style>
          section {
            background-color: #fef3c6;
            padding: 2rem;
          }
          
          section[data-theme="dark"] {
            background-color: #1e293b;
          }

          button {
            margin-bottom: 8px;
          }
          
          h1 {
            color: #1c1917;
            font-size: 1.5rem;
            font-weight: 600;
            margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
          }
          
          section[data-theme="dark"] h1 {
            color: #f1f5f9;
          }
          
          p {
            color: #78716c;
            line-height: 1.6;
          }
          
          section[data-theme="dark"] p {
            color: #94a3b8;
          }
        </style>
        <button onclick="toggleTheme()">Toggle theme</button>
        <section data-theme="light">
          <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
          <p>This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!</p>
        </section>
        <script>
          function toggleTheme() {
            const section = document.querySelector('[data-theme]');
            const currentTheme = section.getAttribute('data-theme');
            section.setAttribute('data-theme', currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
          }
        </script>
      `}
      style={{
        width: "100%",
        height: "250px",
        background: "white",
        colorScheme: "light",
      }}
      sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
      className="h-auto w-full"
    />
  </example-preview>
</example-section>

The primary issue here is that this is not maintainable at all. If we wanted to swap colors, we would need to find and replace every single color variable in the CSS. Writing new elements also requires assigning two different color classes for each element, which is a pain. To solve this, we establish a layered system using Tailwind's theme variables:

1. **Define semantic theme variables** using the `@theme` directive. This creates utility classes like `text-foreground` and `bg-background` that Tailwind generates automatically. We use the `inline` option here to prevent weird variable resolution issues that I won't get into.
2. **Define the actual colors** in the `:root` block. Since we have variables that reference variables, at the second level we can freely swap them out based on the `data-theme` attribute.

```css title="styles.css"
@import "tailwindcss";

@custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *));

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
  --color-muted-foreground: var(--muted-foreground);
}

:root {
  --background: var(--color-amber-100);
  --foreground: var(--color-stone-900);
  --muted-foreground: var(--color-stone-500);
}

html[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background: var(--color-slate-800);
  --foreground: var(--color-slate-100);
  --muted-foreground: var(--color-slate-400);
}
```

We now refactor our classes to use the new semantic variables:

<example-section class="grid grid-cols-1 my-4 [&_*]:m-0">
  <example-source>
    ```html title="index.html" add="text-foreground" add="text-muted-foreground" add="bg-background" startLineNumber={2}
    <section class="bg-background" data-theme="light">
      <h1 class="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">
        Welcome to our website
      </h1>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        This is a really cool website with great colors and fonts!
      </p>
    </section>
    ```
  </example-source>
</example-section>

This looks just so much better than the old versions, and it's easier to maintain.

<Callout variant="remark" title="Native approaches">
While Tailwind (in my opinion) is phenomenal <abbr title="Developer Experience">DX</abbr> for its tradeoff, native CSS in 2025 is also awesome and viable in this use case! Here, we can use `color-scheme: light dark{:css}` to automatically apply the correct colors based on the user's system preference, and then use `light-dark(){:css}` to apply different styles for each theme:

```css title="styles.css"
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
  /* Since Tailwind isn't imported here, these color variables won't actually resolve. This is just for demonstration purposes. */
  --background: light-dark(var(--color-amber-100), var(--color-slate-800));
  --foreground: light-dark(var(--color-stone-900), var(--color-slate-100));
  --muted-foreground: light-dark(var(--color-stone-500), var(--color-slate-400));
}
```

If you wish to let the user override their preference, you can do so with a picker that toggles the `color-scheme` property. Although you can't actually save user preference without JavaScript, this is a progressive enhancement opportunity.

#### Choosing colors with oklch()

For all of my color palettes, I use a simpler version of the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) naming convention, which likes to specify foreground-background pairs. I cut down the variables to only include relevant ones:

```css title="styles.css" del={2, 5-8, 11-12, 15-16, 19, 21-33}
:root {
  --radius: /* ... */rem;
  --background: oklch(/* ... */);
  --foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --card: oklch(/* ... */);
  --card-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --popover: oklch(/* ... */);
  --popover-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --primary: oklch(/* ... */);
  --primary-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --secondary: oklch(/* ... */);
  --secondary-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --muted: oklch(/* ... */);
  --muted-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --accent: oklch(/* ... */);
  --accent-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --destructive: oklch(/* ... */);
  --border: oklch(/* ... */);
  --input: oklch(/* ... */);
  --ring: oklch(/* ... */);
  --chart-1: oklch(/* ... */);
  --chart-2: oklch(/* ... */);
  --chart-3: oklch(/* ... */);
  --chart-4: oklch(/* ... */);
  --chart-5: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-primary: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-primary-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-accent: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-accent-foreground: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-border: oklch(/* ... */);
  --sidebar-ring: oklch(/* ... */);
}
```

For choosing the colors themselves, this was done by [manually fiddling](https://oklch.com) with [`oklch()` notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch). `oklch()` is objectively the perfect way to work with color, because its only inherent limitations are **(1)** the literal human eye, **(2)** visual display/monitor capabilities, and **(3)** it being too new.

If you haven't seen `oklch()` before, the format is `oklch(L C H / a)`. Here, `L` is "perceived" lightness <span class="text-muted-foreground">(dark to bright, 0–1)</span>, `C` is chroma <span class="text-muted-foreground">(dull to vivid, 0–∞)</span>, `H` is hue angle <span class="text-muted-foreground">(0–360°)</span>, and `a` is optional alpha/opacity. If you had no idea what any of that meant, here are explanations:
- The reason why the lightness `L` is preceded by "perceived" is because there is a difference between perceptual uniformity and mathematical uniformity. One of the primary drawbacks of HSL was that if we were to define a yellow and a blue at 50% lightness, the blue looks much "darker" than the yellow:

  <color-comparison class="grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-3 items-center justify-center my-6 [&_*]:m-0">
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-1">
      <color-box class="h-16 w-full bg-[hsl(50,100%,50%)]" />
      <figcaption class="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground [&>p]:text-xs text-center">
        hsl(<span class="text-foreground font-medium">50</span> 100% 50%)
      </figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-1">
      <color-box class="h-16 w-full bg-[hsl(220,100%,50%)]" />
      <figcaption class="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground [&>p]:text-xs text-center">
        hsl(<span class="text-foreground font-medium">220</span> 100% 50%)
      </figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-1">
      <color-box class="h-16 w-full bg-[oklch(0.8_0.18_97)]" />
      <figcaption class="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground [&>p]:text-xs text-center">
        oklch(0.8 0.18 <span class="text-foreground font-medium">97</span>)
      </figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-1">
      <color-box class="h-16 w-full bg-[oklch(0.8_0.18_264)]" />
      <figcaption class="[&>p]:text-muted-foreground [&>p]:text-xs text-center">
        oklch(0.8 0.18 <span class="text-foreground font-medium">264</span>)
      </figcaption>
    </div>
  </color-comparison>

  Note that the hue angles here are different because 0° in `oklch()` <span class="text-muted-foreground">(which uses [CIELab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) color space due to its perceptual uniformity)</span> is roughly magenta, while 0° in `hsl()` <span class="text-muted-foreground">(which uses the ancient [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space)</span> is roughly red.

- The chroma `C` is technically unbounded because **(1)** its maximum depends on your hardware <span class="text-muted-foreground">(higher-end monitors can display a wider range of colors)</span>, and **(2)** the highest possible chroma also varies depending on the specific lightness-hue pairing. You don't need to worry about exceeding the limit, since browsers will automatically clamp out-of-gamut values to the closest displayable color. However, in practice values above `0.4` aren't useful <span class="text-muted-foreground">(`0.4` is what you get if you use `100%` chroma in percentage notation)</span>.
- The `H` in `oklch()` is called a hue "angle" because the color space is defined using polar coordinates: `C` is the chroma (distance from the center), and `H` is the angle around the color wheel. This is more intuitive for most people than the Cartesian coordinates used in `oklab(L a b)` <span class="text-muted-foreground">(where `a` and `b` is a point `(a, b)` in color space)</span>, thus making it easier to fiddle with colors.

For my specific color palette, I started with the color <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-[oklch(0.8775_0.0458_75)] size-4 border" /> oklch(0.8775 0.0458 75)</code> to be my "accent" color <span class="text-muted-foreground">(which would be `--color-primary` in shadcn/ui convention)</span>. From here, you can define colors "around" this color:

Here are some general comments on my thought process behind both the selection of colors and their usage:
- Everything should have the same hue angle, meaning we can change it however we want and the colors will adjust relative to each other. For example, if we swap all the 75s to 200s, the entire website will become a nice baby blue:

- I chose a dark gray for <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-background border size-4" /> background</code> instead of pure black to create a sense of warmth (when we change the hue angle from 75° to 200° above, this becomes a "cool gray"). This is a very subtle warmth that helps the other colors feel more cohesive, rather than isolated against a stark and neutral black. See the following:

- <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-foreground border size-4" /> foreground</code> will only ever be used for text elements. We'll never do anything like <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-foreground border size-4" /> bg-foreground</code> because this is very unintuitive. I chose <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-foreground border size-4" /> foreground</code> to be a slightly desaturated and brighter version of <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-primary border size-4" /> primary</code> so that the text contrast is still good.
- We can't do <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-foreground border size-4" /> text-foreground <span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-background border size-4" /> bg-background</code> for prose text because the contrast is too stark. I like to establish a hierarchy here, with the following levels:
  1. <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-foreground border size-4" /> text-foreground</code> exists for bold text and links. This is different from <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-primary border size-4" /> text-primary</code>, which is only used for SVG icons due to SVGs inheriting text color.
  2. <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-foreground/80 border size-4" /> text-foreground/80</code> exists for prose text. It's softer due to it being lower contrast, and thus it's easier on the eyes to read.
  3. <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-muted-foreground border size-4" /> text-muted-foreground</code> exists for secondary text, captions, or less important details. 
  4. <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-muted-foreground/60 border size-4" /> text-muted-foreground/60</code> exists for things that are meant to be irrelevant or disabled. For example, if you're on a desktop, the headers from the parent post will be this color because they're not relevant to this post.

- <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-primary border size-4" /> primary</code> is only really used for backgrounds on buttons, badges, and icons. Text within <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-primary border size-4" /> primary</code>-colored buttons and badges is the only case where we'll use <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-primary-foreground border size-4" /> text-primary-foreground</code>, which I chose to be the same color as <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-muted border size-4" /> muted</code> rather than <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-background border size-4" /> background</code>:

- <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-muted border size-4" /> muted</code> is used similarly to "secondary" in the 60-30-10 rule to help establish a hierarchy above the <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-background border size-4" /> background</code> color. It's most often used when hovering over elements that would otherwise be <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-background border size-4" /> background</code>-colored, or to indicate that a hovered element is considered active. If there is already an existing active element, hovering over elements will instead use <code class="bg-background"><span class="inline-block align-text-bottom bg-muted/50 border size-4" /> muted/50</code> to differentiate.
