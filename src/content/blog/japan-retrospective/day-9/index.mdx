## Day 9: Yokohama, Shibuya

![Day 9](../assets/day-9.webp)

Today our primary plan was to visit the [Cup Noodles Museum](https://www.cupnoodles-museum.jp/en/) in Yokohama as a fun family event! To get to Yokohama, we actually opted out of going to Shinjuku station and instead went to [Shinjuku-Sanch≈çme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku-sanch%C5%8Dme_Station) station, which is a bit further but comes with the benefit that it's served by the [Fukutoshin Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metro_Fukutoshin_Line), which does throughway service to Yokohama (and hence when going back to Tokyo, it's called the [Minatomirai Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minatomirai_Line) instead due to point of origin).

### Yokohama City

This part of Yokohama (called [Minatomirai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minato_Mirai_21)) was very different from Shinjuku in terms of architecture and vibe due to it being primarily a business-oriented area. The architecture was significantly less "in-your-face" and overwhelming than interior Shinjuku, and both the streets and sidewalks were wider and emptier. The buildings were sleek and almost futuristic, with wide open spaces between them that let you actually see the sky. The sidewalks themselves had no tourists and were instead sparsely populated with businesspeople and commuters:

Despite this professionalism, there is for some reason a gigantic ferris wheel (which is part of [Yokohama Cosmo World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Cosmo_World) theme park) in the middle of this neighborhood, which I found to be quite amusing:

### Cup Noodles Museum, Lunch

The Cup Noodles Museum was a delightful family-friendly experience! The main attraction was definitely the "My Cup Noodle Factory" experience where you get to create your own personalized Cup Noodle from start to finish. You start by decorating the outside of the Cup Noodle container with markers, and then you move to a buffet-style line where you get to pick your soup base and toppings. The staff then seals the Cup Noodle right in front of you:

We were quite proud of our artistry on the exterior of the cup, and they even provide these neat inflatable protective bags to ensure our creation survives the journey home inside luggage. The second picture below was actually taken in the food court of the museum, which was themed to look like a food truck area with each truck representing a different culture's interpretation of noodles. We ended up having lunch there:

The museum itself was quite interesting and focused on documenting the very storied history of instant noodles, alongside their very important role in post-WWII reconstruction efforts. My favorite exhibit was a room where all four walls were just completely covered in varieties of instant noodles, ordered by the year they were initially manufactured:
