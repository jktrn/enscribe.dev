## Introduction

This is a writeup for the buffer overflow series during the **picoCTF 2022** competition. This was arguably my favorite set of challenges, as beforehand I'd never stepped into the realm of binary exploitation/pwn. I learned a lot from this, so I highly recommend solving it by yourself before referencing this document. Cheers!
