## Intro

[SekaiCTF 2022](http://2022.ctf.sekai.team/) — my first capture-the-flag which I've had the honor of organizing alongside fellow members of [Project Sekai CTF](https://sekai.team). One of the aspects of its administration was the challenge verification process; as part of it, I've ended up authoring a bunch of forensics-based writeups which I'm really proud of. They're also available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/project-sekai-ctf/sekaictf-2022) repository if you'd like to check out the rest of the challenges — I've simply ported them over here for my fancy website formatting. Enjoy!
