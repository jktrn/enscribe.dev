</Challenge>

import Code1 from './assets/1.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code1} lang="ansi" />

Let's look at what happens when you run that binary given to us:

import Code2 from './assets/2.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code2} lang="ansi" />

This error is because the binary is probably trying to reference a `flag.txt` within its directory that doesn't exist. Let's create one and run it again:

import Code3 from './assets/3.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code3} lang="ansi" />

There, we got it to work locally. Since we know that this is problem a format string vulnerability from the "find a successful distraction format" part of the description, let's assume that the vulnerability is it writing our input to the stack with `printf(){:c}`. We will need to work our way up the stack with the format `%n$s{:c}`, where `n{:c}` is the decimal index of the argument you want, and `s` is the `printf(){:c}` specifier for a **string of characters**. Here is a Python script used to brute force our way up:

import Code4 from './assets/4.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code4} lang="py" title="solve.py" />

This script will send a UTF-8 encoded format string, with `str(i)` being the iterating variable. If its output contains the flag, the loop breaks and the script will stop. Let's run it:

import Code5 from './assets/5.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code5} lang="ansi" mark={24} />
