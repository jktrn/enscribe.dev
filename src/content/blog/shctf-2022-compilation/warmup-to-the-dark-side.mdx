Let's run that `netcat` link to see what's going on:

import Code14 from './assets/14.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code14} lang="ansi" />

We're given an address of the `win(){:c}` function... and that's it. If this is a `ret2win` challenge, how are we meant to find the offset of the `$rip` register and overflow it with our code? Of course... we need to brute force it.

In the code snippet below, I got the address provided in the prompt by reading the line and taking its substring (ASLR is enabled, so it's different each time). Then, I slowly increased the buffer of the payload with a loop until I found the correct offset of the `$rip`:

import Code15 from './assets/15.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code15} lang="py" title="solve.py" />

Let's run this script on the server to see if we can get the flag:

import Code16 from './assets/16.txt?raw'

<Code code={Code16} lang="ansi" mark={17} />
