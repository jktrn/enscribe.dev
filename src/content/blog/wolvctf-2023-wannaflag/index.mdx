## Introduction

Over the last weekend, I played in WolvSec's second CTF iteration with [Project Sekai](https://sekai.team/) — [WolvCTF 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/1866). We placed first in the open division, and throughout the solving process I became intrigued by a specific series of challenges placed under the OSINT category: **WannaFlag**. Telling a story of a supposed ransomware group which had been terrorizing the CTF community for the past several months, these series of challenges offered an opportunity for players to track down this group's means of operation. Ultimately, the goal was to find WannaFlag's kingpin through all possible methods.

Project Sekai was the first to blood the entire series. Here was our thought process, notes, and conclusions.
